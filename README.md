# HARMAN's ARU DEMO PROJECT

This project has both front end and back end. The front end is in Angular 8 and i used firebase for the back end. I used the real time database provided by firebase to store and fetch both the inventory list and customers list. Firebase's REST API was used to make calls to the database to get and post data. I used rxjs subject to ensure effective cross component communication. I used bootstrap3 framework for rapid and responsive CSS development. I deployed this App in firebase hosting. Its only a pure coincidence that my back end and my hosting provider is the same. My firebase back end will still work correctly if i decided to deploy the app somwhere else
